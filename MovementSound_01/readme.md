## Movement && Sound

### Goals:

1. See and Hear
2. Paperize
3. Read
4. Read More


#### 1. See and Hear
Combine Visual and Aural elements. Completed projects will be projected and connected to the speaker system; unless requiring unique viewing/hearing hardware, for example: Oculus Rift. Completed projects are not required to be interactive. Completed projects can be infinitely evolving, reactive, and so on.

#### 2. Paperize
Before getting code dirty, draw/write out the bits and pieces of what you think you'll need. What are the components? How should they connect? Is there an order to events? 

#### 3. Read
In all of these, ski[p,m] the Processing parts. 

_Programming Interactivity_, Chapter 5, This one is up to you: Object Oriented Programming, Pointers, References, and Arrays. When Are You Going to Use This?  -> page 157. 

_Programming Interactivity_, Chapter 6, This one is also up to you: Review of things we've done, OF tour, IDE's, setup, debugging. 

_Programming Interactivity_, Chapter 8, Graphics, Animation, Vectors. 

_Programming Interactivity_, Chapter 9, Pixel data. 

_Programming Interactivity_, Chapter 10, Sound. 

_Programming Interactivity_, Chapter 13, This one is also up to you: 3D. Or just the shader part on pages 520 - 529.

#### 4. Read More
A few more things to read are in the [google drive here](https://drive.google.com/folderview?id=0BwTG9v1wttXLV0UtZmJMNkVkRzA&usp=sharing). We won't have time to directly talk about them, but are good to think about.
